Buzzer
======

Run this program together with Buzzer buttons, orgininally for
PlayStation.

I use it for quiz that I ocassionally run. It's not production ready, but ok for an inital release 0.1

Build
-----
The program uses Qt4, so you would need the qt SDK. I used Qt Creator to manage the project.
There is an additional dependency, joystick++, which now is a part of PLIB at http://plib.sourceforge.net
